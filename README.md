# Personalized HealthCV
This branch is adding personalized features into the system from `main` branch, that is suggesting personalized workout path based on the fitness goal.

- if user login for the first time, ask they to specify their fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, endurance, flexibility).
- Then, based on the fitness goal, suggest a workout template for they (the workout template is in chatgpt). some of the exercises can still be replaced by strength training but with appropriate set count and rep count (refer to the link above)
- when the user goes to the home page, they can do whatever exercise they want. Or choose to follow the suggested paths by the system (and the system will show which tasks hv been completed like a lot of online games)
